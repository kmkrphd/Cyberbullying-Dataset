# Cyberbullying-Dataset

The provided dataset contains 500 samples specifically designed for cyberbullying detection research. This dataset integrates multiple modalities, including text, image (features), and video (features) content, along with user metadata and engagement metrics. Each sample includes comprehensive features that enable detailed analysis and model training for detecting cyberbullying behaviors. The diversity and richness of the data make it an invaluable resource for developing and validating advanced machine-learning models aimed at understanding and mitigating online harassment.

Text Content
The text content in this dataset consists of various messages, comments, and posts typically found on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The samples include both direct and subtle forms of cyberbullying, ranging from overt insults ("You are so foolish!") to more nuanced aggressive statements ("Why don't you depart?"). Key textual features such as emotional tone, profanity usage, sarcasm, aggression levels, and the presence of derogatory language are included to provide a comprehensive view of the textual aspects of cyberbullying.

Image Content
The image content features offensive gestures and other visual cues commonly associated with cyberbullying. This includes images depicting rude hand signs, insulting memes, and other forms of visual harassment. Visual features such as object detection (e.g., harmful objects, middle finger) and color analysis (e.g., red, green) are included to capture the context and severity of the images.

Video Content
The video content captures dynamic bullying behaviors in scenarios like school hallways or public spaces. Each sample in this category includes descriptions of bullying actions (e.g., punching, verbal abuse) and audio cues where applicable. Temporal dynamics and scene context are analyzed to understand the sequence and environment in which bullying occurs. Video features such as action recognition and duration of the bullying act are integral to the dataset, providing a realistic portrayal of cyberbullying incidents.
User Metadata and Engagement Metrics
User metadata includes age, gender, location, and user history, which are crucial for understanding the demographics and behavioral patterns of both bullies and victims. Engagement metrics such as likes, shares, and comments offer insights into the social dynamics and the impact of the content. These metrics help in assessing the reach and reaction to the bullying content, providing context for the severity and spread of cyberbullying.

Contextual and Interaction Features
The dataset also includes contextual features such as timestamps, interaction networks (friends and followers), and sentiment scores. Timestamps help in understanding the temporal aspect of cyberbullying, while interaction networks provide information about the social connections and interactions of the users involved. Sentiment scores, ranging from -1 to -0.5, indicate the emotional tone of the text, with negative scores reflecting a higher likelihood of aggressive or bullying content.

Data Retrieval and Computation
The data in this dataset were retrieved from simulated scenarios based on typical interactions and content found on social media platforms. Text samples were generated using natural language processing techniques to mimic real-world cyberbullying language. Image and video content were created using descriptions of common bullying behaviors and visual cues. User metadata and engagement metrics were randomly assigned within realistic ranges to reflect typical social media activity.

Significance for Cyberbullying Research
This elaborated dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for cyberbullying research, enabling the development of robust detection models. The integration of multi-modal data ensures that researchers can explore the complex interactions between different types of content and user behaviors. By providing detailed features and realistic samples, this dataset supports the advancement of cyberbullying detection technologies, contributing to the creation of safer online environments. Researchers can use this dataset to train and validate models, identify patterns, and develop interventions to combat cyberbullying effectively.
